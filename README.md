This OmniFocus script allows to defer tasks in a smart way. To be precise, it does the following:

- if the task has no defer date, it will deter to tomorrow honouring defer time settings (OmniFocus Preferences)
- if the task has a defer date, it will defer to tomorrow *preserving* time
- if the task has an interval, it will defer according to the interval *preserving* time and days (if applies)

### How do I get set up? ###

- Copy script to OmniFocus scripts folder
- Drag script's icon to toolbar

>**Warning** don't forget to set the encoding to `MacRoman` if you are going to edit the script **Warning**
